/* 
JavaScript Objects - Object Creation Functions, Inheritance, Properties, Methods, Instantiation
*/

// Object: An instance or replica of a class that has certain traits that belong to it. 
// For example, a car is an object that has doors, wheels, seats, AC etc...

// Objects have variables: entry, doors and seating are variable in this case.
var car = new Car {entry: "doors", seating: "seats"};

// JavaScript Objects can be created in many ways:
// Object Creation Function:
function Car(make, model, year, mileage) {
  this.make = make;
  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;
  this.mileage = mileage;
  
  this.go() {do stuff..};
}
// This function is the prototype for the object Car.
// We have created a Car object now that can be used as a prototype for other car objects.


// Inheritance & Properties & Methods & Instantiation:

// From this prototype objects can be created and they will inherit it's properties and functions. 
// This would be an instantiation of the Car prototype

var corolla = new Car("toyota", "corolla", "2005", "150000");

// To access the variables in an object you can use either dot notation or bracket notation:
// Dot:
corolla.make;
// Bracket:
corolla["make"];

// Full Example:
var person = new Person {height: 6, weight: 180};
if (person.height == 6) {
  print("success!");
}

// success!
